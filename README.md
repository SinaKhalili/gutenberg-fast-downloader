# gutenberg fast downloader
A python script to download all english language files from project gutenberg fast (at least faster than the other projects I could find) by using asyncio

## Usage
install the requirements in `requirements.txt` and then
```bash
python main.py
```
will begin to download the files in a `gutenberg` folder in the same place the script was ran.
